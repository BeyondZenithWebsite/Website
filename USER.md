# USER.md - About Your Human

_Learn about the person you're helping. Update this as you go._

- **Name:** Anastas
- **What to call them:** Anastas
- **Pronouns:** _(optional)_
- **Timezone:** Australia/Melbourne
- **Notes:** Prefers practical, direct, technical communication. No fluff. Default behavior: ask only 1–3 clarifying questions when truly blocking; otherwise make best-call and execute. Prefer simplest/lowest-dependency approach. Optimize for old Intel Mac mini (4GB RAM): low concurrency, avoid heavy installs, avoid Docker unless absolutely required. When suggesting a path, include a fast rollback/escape hatch.

## Context

_(What do they care about? What projects are they working on? What annoys them? What makes them laugh? Build this over time.)_

The more you know, the better you can help. But remember — you're learning about a person, not building a dossier. Respect the difference.
