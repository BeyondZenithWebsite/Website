# MEMORY.md

## Projects
- BeyondZenith website is hosted on GitHub Pages at: https://beyondzenithwebsite.github.io/Website/
- User wants to connect custom domain `www.beyondzenith.org` (domain managed in Squarespace) to this GitHub Pages site.

## Preferences
- User explicitly asked the assistant to remember operational details like URLs, hosting setup, and domain/provider info so they do not need to repeat them.
- User preference: Do **not** use Zapier MCP for email tasks; use `gog` from now on.
